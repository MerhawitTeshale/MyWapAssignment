1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
                x = 1;
                var a = 5;
                var b = 10;
                var c = function(a, b, c) {
                var x = 10;
                document.write(x);
                document.write(a);
                var f = function(a, b, c) {
                b = a;
                document.write(b);
                b = c;
                var x = 5;
                }
                f(a,b,c);
                document.write(b);
                }
                c(8,9,10);
                document.write(b);
                document.write(x);
                }

    answer: the out put is 10,8,8,9,10,1

2. What is the difference between a method and function

    answer:A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks. 
        We can define a function using the function keyword, followed by Name and optional parameters. 
        Body of function is enclosed in Curly braces.

        A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. 
        Methods are functions stored as object properties.
3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

    answer: this in java shows the variable that is declared inside the class
4.What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

    answer: we dont know, we can Determine the value of this until the function is called

5. what does 'this' refer to when used in javaScript constructor function?
    answer: it is like access protected access specificer, it will allow all the objects created to have these properties

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
    
    answer:
7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?

    answer: it is a variable that is defined on upper levels of function, it means if not defined inside our context and we
            are using it then it is free variable

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

    answer: obj={
        name:'fred',
        major:'music'

        return{
	       func:function(a,b){
                var hold=[];
                if(a===b){
                    hold.push(a*a)
                    hold.push(b*b)
                    return hold;
                }else{
                    return a<b?a:b;
                }
            }   
        }
    }
9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

    class Employee {
        constructor(name, salary,position){
            this.name=name;
            this.salary=salary;
            this.position=position;
        }
    }

    var employee1= new Employee('merhawit','10000','fullstackdeveloper')
    var employee2= new Employee('Arsema','5000','accounting')
    var employee3= new Employee('Kisanet','5000','designer')

10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.
var anynumber=function(a,b, ...more){
        var result=a*b;
        for(var i of more){
            result*=i;
        }

        return result;
    }

11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.

    var maxOfThree=function((a,b,c)=>return {
        var max;
        if(a>b && a>c) return a;
        else if(b>c) return b;
        else return c;
    })
