1.What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
    setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
    setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

    the first one will call the booyah function after 2 seconds delay
    the second one will call the booyah function imediatly and then call the returned value (if any) after 2 second delay

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
    var myfunc = function(a, x) {
            return a * x;
        };
    var x = myfunc(2, 3);
    var y = myfunc;
    alert(x);
    // this will dispaly 6 
    alert(y(2,3));// will display 6 as well

 
3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says “BOOYAH!”
    setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
    function booyah1(){
        alert("boyah1");
    }
    setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
    function booyah2(){
        return boyahh(){
            alert("boyah2")
        }
    }
4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
